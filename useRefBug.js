This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that is unmounted before the ref's callback is executed.  This commonly happens when navigating away from a screen or when the component is removed from the render tree before an asynchronous operation using the ref completes.  The error message itself might not be explicit, but the application might crash or behave erratically, sometimes without an obvious stack trace.
