To prevent this error, ensure that your asynchronous operations using the ref include a check to see if the component is still mounted.  React provides the `isMounted` flag for class components and the equivalent checking in a functional component is to keep track of the component state with useState. This ensures that the ref's callback is only executed if the component still exists in the DOM.

Here's an example of how to solve the problem using a functional component and the `useState` hook:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [isMounted, setIsMounted] = useState(true);
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    return () => setIsMounted(false);
  }, []);

  const myCallback = () => {
    if (isMounted && myRef.current) {
      // Access and manipulate myRef.current safely
      console.log('Ref value:', myRef.current);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>This is my component</Text>
      <Button title="Trigger Callback" onPress={myCallback} />
    </View>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

This approach ensures that the callback function `myCallback` will only attempt to interact with `myRef.current` if the component remains mounted (`isMounted` is true).
